        <p>Regular off-leash exercise in designated off-leash parks helps dogs relieve boredom and release pent-up energy. It may also reduce unwanted behaviour such as excessive barking. Outdoors exercise also benefits owners with dog parks bringing people together.</p>
        <p>Sydney has become a city that loves its dogs. If you’re thinking about taking your dog out this weekend, or if you’re up for some dog watching, here are some great spots we can recommend.<br> Exercising regularly has benefits for both you and your dog. Our off-leash parks are perfect if you want to get outdoors with the furriest member of your family.</p>
